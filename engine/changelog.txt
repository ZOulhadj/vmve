- Functions return boolean values based on if a system has been initialized instead of returning a pointer to that value.
     This allows for easier detection of errors. Also, if a system was only able to initialize half way then we still
     have a valid object pointer but we return false. This allows us to check against this value and free any resources
     allocated by that object.
